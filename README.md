# CodingCalculus - Summary of Work Fall 2024
This repository will contain the classwork and class contributions that I have done for Coding Calculus Seminar, CSPB 4830 in Fall 2024. This includes:

- Class work and Assignments
- Online Discussions

This document is ordered week-by-week, and will highlight some of the work I feel best about from each week! At the end of this ReadMe, I will also write a brief self-reflection on my performance in the class so far. 

## Week 1: Calculus in Context
This week, we started working with SIRPlot, a code that models the spread of a disease over time by modeling susceptible, infected, and recovered populations over time. This was a good introduction to using calculus in coding - having largely only done calculus by hand, modeling the changes in these populations over time in Python was a good review of some basic concepts and how to implement them in Python. 

So that everything is in the same place, I have added the PDF write up in this repository.
## Week 2: Euler's Method
## Week 3: Derivatives
## Week 4: Derivatives as Functions
